# EverQuest Game

Project Abstract

This project would be a completely brand-new project that would be required to be developed from scratch. The base implementation of this project is a simple idea that would require to start with a superclass that would have multiple subclasses. It is a game-oriented design, where each class would have its own design and unique features. All these classes would be unique, though there would be some specific qualities that they would all have in common. The idea of this project is to assimilate a type of fighting game that would allow the user to interact and react to different scenarios. The game would also have a storyline that will occur based on the userâ€™s interaction, which would instigate the user to continue to play. Therefore, there needs to be a computer design to play with the user or if possible, to create a multi-player option, so both users can experience the game to its full potential. 


Project Relevance

    In general, this project is linked to the education goals of this class, because it allows us to work with different types of applications like Object oriented Design, Test development with a variant of different methods and a decent amount of debugging, as this project would start from scratch it will require a lot of work and debugging. Also, it would require multiple drafts that include using UML language, because the implementation may require multiple changes through the development. Using these applications would help the development of this project, as well as the understanding of some of these concepts for the students.
    
A one-paragraph description of your proposed contribution.

    My proposed contribution to this project would be from scratch, as it is a self-developed idea that I thought would be interesting and difficult. Therefore, there would be a lot of work included on the design of this project. There would be storyline to figure out, which could take a lot of time to develop, as well as different types of classes that can be very complex to develop. There would also be sharing futures of each class that would have to be determined and the different effects depending on the class type. The design of this project would be complex depending on the different methods used. This is just a visual representation of the idea, but it might require multiple drafts, debugging and it will be very time consuming designing these concepts. There must be clear instructions of how the game would be played, purpose, rules. Therefore, this project could be very time consuming, though it would reflect on my testing, debugging, UML and object-oriented design skills, which would help my understanding on some of these features.
